A package to ensamble convenience types commonly used through flutter projects developed by Capyba.

## Motivation

Along our development cycle of numerous projects we have adopted the usage of some types that help us to keep things safer, more error prone and, in the long run, more productive. In order to share those types between the projects we work, and possibly to inspire others to use those types too, we have created this package.
